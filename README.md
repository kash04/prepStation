# prepStation
A simple prep station for epoxy, finishes, and other goods. Can also function as a stand-up workstation.

Thank you for downloading this set of files to make your own prep station. You’ll find fusion and step archives, as well as dxf (vector) files of each component. This design is a bit material-heavy and requires about 3 and a half 4x8 sheets of 18mm baltic birch plywood and assumes your plywood is truly .72”. While this is not always the case, I have found 18mm baltic birch to fit in that range, though some home improvement store plywood might be a tad thicker. I recommend assembling this with Spax brand 1 1/2” MDF+Hardwood T15 self-drilling screws.

This design is free to use and share - both free as in beer and free as in freedom, and we appreciate you crediting us and sharing alike.
